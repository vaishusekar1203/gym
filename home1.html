                <p>Combining aerobic exercise with other kinds of exercises like strength training with weights and stretching
                    keeps muscles, ligaments, joints, and tendons healthy, flexible, and strong, so when one becomes older, he
                    is stronger and has less risk of being out of balance and falling causing fractures or other injuries. One
                    also gets good posture when muscles are well-formed. That is why the person should select the right
                    exercises for each muscle group.<br><br>
        
                    Suppose one does not like to work with exercise machines but still likes to exercise. In that case, gyms
                    also offer group exercises, including boot camp exercises in teams, cycling sessions on stationary bicycles,
                    martial arts exercises like body combat, boxing, etc., and plenty of dance routines like Zumba, HipHop,
                    Ballroom Dancing, etc. It can be fun to meet new people, so social life comes alive.

                    <p>Many reasons to go to gym. Of course, exercise is a priority. The gym has plenty of exercise machines that
                        people can use to develop different muscle groups. Kulas (para. 1), in her article, “The Advantages of Going
                        to the Gym Every Day,” says at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise should be done by adults five days a
                        week, so going to the gym every day will meet that goal. It will result in good physical and mental health.
            <br><br>
                        Aside from exercising, one can meet new friends like fitness instructors and others. It’s good to be with
                        people with the same interests so that all can motivate each other to keep their fitness goals.
                        When one exercises, the heart becomes stronger, so it efficiently pumps blood to the body to keep vital
                        organs healthy and in order. For example, blood pressure is maintained instead of spike high, cholesterol
                        and triglyceride levels are kept low, and heart disease is kept at bay. It means there is less chance of a
                        heart attack, stroke, or any other disease when one exercises regularly.</p>
